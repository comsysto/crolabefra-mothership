# crolabefra-mothership
This root-project - or in my words 'mothership' - plugin executes CroLaBeFra-enabled micro-benchmarks, collects the results and brings them together in one common dashboard.

In order to do a one-command run of all benchmark executors and merge all results together in one dashboard, please execute

    $> gradle crolabefra
    
The mentioned HTML dashboard can be found in {$ROOT_PROJECT_DIR}/build/results/mothership/index.html

## POC project
This [POC project](https://github.com/bensteinert/crolabefra-setup-poc) gives a usage example and describes the use case.
